# My first bot

This is an example bot, which can be used as a base for you to build your own bot upon. It uses the Botsquad basebot skills.

You can read more about default bot behavior here: [Base bot](https://doc.botsquad.com/platform/bot/base_bot/).

Quick start:
1. Add an intent in the [Intents page](/intents/file%3Aintents
2. Read about [BubbleScript](https://doc.botsquad.com/bubblescript/getting_started) here.
3. Open main in the [Build page](/build/BOT_ID)
4. Add a 'dialog label: "my intent", do: invoke my_intent to the root dialog.
5. Add a dialog my_intent, trigger: [@my_intent] do ... end dialog at the bottom.
